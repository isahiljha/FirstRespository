// Why Git and GitHUB?
- if you wanna collaborate with other people in a project.
- if you want to see how the code (which you wrote in the past) for your application used to look in the past time.
- history of your application or project.
- helps us to contribute to open source
- which person made which change where in the project, git helps us in doing that. (open source)

// what is GitHUB?
- a platform or online website which help us to host our git repositories
- repository is like basically a folder where all the changes are saved


// GitHUB is version control system which allow us to host your projects online
// there are also a lot of other online platform services that also offer us to host our repositories like 
// GitLab,Bitbucket etc..

// why do we use terminal 
// terminal allows us to manipulate the file structure using commands 
// change directory --> double clicking on the directory/folder

// Where is entire history being stored?
// it stores in a folder that git provide us known as git repository
// folder name --> .git (these files are hidden)

// how to get this folder?
// commands : 
// git init --> initilizes empty git repository
// ls -a (-a --> show me all the hidden files)
// ls .git (to see what's inside this git folder)
// touch --> to create a file
// cd project --> double click
// git status
// git add individualFileNames (names.text) or AllAtOnce (.) --> on stage
// git commit -m "names.txt file added"  --> click photo
   -m --> message "message goes here"


// vi names.txt --> text editor 
// cat names.txt --> to show what's in file

// git restore --staged names.txt --> removing file from stage without commiting it
// 6 insertions(+) --> because 6 lines were added by me


// git log --> to see entire history of the project
// rm -rf names.txt --> to delete this file names.txt


// you can't remove any commit from middle,
// you have to unstage them from the top of the commits
